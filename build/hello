# SYNOPSIS
#
#   HELLO BUILD
#
# OVERVIEW
#
#   We generate a line at the start of each Makefile run, because if we
#   use `make V=0` mode then the terminal logging trick we use in
#   tool/build/compile.c will delete the previous line, and we'd rather
#   have that line not be the bash prompt that ran make.
#
#   This script is also useful for giving us an indicator each time the
#   build restarts itself from scratch, which can happen in cases like
#   when dependencies need to be regenerated by tool/build/mkdeps.c
