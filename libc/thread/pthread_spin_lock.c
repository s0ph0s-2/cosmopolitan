/**
 * Acquires spin lock.
 *
 * If the lock is already held, this function will wait for it to become
 * available. No genuine error conditions are currently defined. This is
 * similar to pthread_mutex_lock() except spin locks are much simpler so
 * this API is able to offer a performance advantage in situations where
 * scalable contention handling isn't necessary. Spinlocks are also very
 * small especially in MODE=tiny where a lock needs 16 bytes of code and
 * unlocking needs just 5 bytes. The lock object also only takes 1 byte.
 *
 * The posixly correct way to use this API is as follows:
 *
 *     pthread_spinlock_t lock;
 *     pthread_spin_init(&lock, PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE);
 *     pthread_spin_lock(&lock);
 *     // do work...
 *     pthread_spin_unlock(&lock);
 *     pthread_spin_destroy(&lock);
 *
 * Cosmopolitan permits succinct notation for spin locks:
 *
 *     pthread_spinlock_t lock = {0};
 *     pthread_spin_lock(&lock);
 *     // do work...
 *     pthread_spin_unlock(&lock);
 *
 * @return 0 on success, or errno on error
 * @see pthread_spin_trylock
 * @see pthread_spin_unlock
 * @see pthread_spin_init
