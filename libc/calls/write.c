/**
 * Writes data to file descriptor.
 *
 * This function changes the current file position. For documentation
 * on file position behaviors and gotchas, see the lseek() function.
 * This function may be used on socket file descriptors, including on
 * Windows.
 *
 * @param fd is open file descriptor
 * @param buf is copied from, cf. copy_file_range(), sendfile(), etc.
 * @return [1..size] bytes on success, or -1 w/ errno; noting zero is
 *     impossible unless size was passed as zero to do an error check
 * @raise EBADF if `fd` is negative or not an open file descriptor
 * @raise EBADF if `fd` wasn't opened with `O_WRONLY` or `O_RDWR`
 * @raise EPIPE if `fd` is a pipe whose other reader end was closed,
 *     after the `SIGPIPE` signal was delivered, blocked, or ignored
 * @raise EFBIG if `RLIMIT_FSIZE` soft limit was exceeded, after the
 *     `SIGXFSZ` signal was either delivered, blocked, or ignored
 * @raise EFAULT if `size` is nonzero and `buf` points to bad memory
 * @raise EPERM if pledge() is in play without the stdio promise
 * @raise ENOSPC if device containing `fd` is full
 * @raise EIO if low-level i/o error happened
 * @raise EINTR if signal was delivered instead
 * @raise ECANCELED if thread was cancelled in masked mode
 * @raise EAGAIN if `O_NONBLOCK` is in play and write needs to block
 * @raise ENOBUFS if kernel lacked internal resources; which FreeBSD
 *     and XNU say could happen with sockets, and OpenBSD documents it
 *     as a general possibility; whereas other system don't specify it
 * @raise ENXIO is specified only by POSIX and XNU when a request is
 *     made of a nonexistent device or outside device capabilities
 * @cancellationpoint
 * @asyncsignalsafe
 * @restartable
 * @vforksafe
