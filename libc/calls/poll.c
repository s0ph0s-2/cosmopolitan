/**
 * Waits for something to happen on multiple file descriptors at once.
 *
 * Warning: XNU has an inconsistency with other platforms. If you have
 * pollfds with fd≥0 and none of the meaningful events flags are added
 * e.g. POLLIN then XNU won't check for POLLNVAL. This matters because
 * one of the use-cases for poll() is quickly checking for open files.
 *
 * Note: Polling works best on Windows for sockets. We're able to poll
 * input on named pipes. But for anything that isn't a socket, or pipe
 * with POLLIN, (e.g. regular file) then POLLIN/POLLOUT are always set
 * into revents if they're requested, provided they were opened with a
 * mode that permits reading and/or writing.
 *
 * Note: Windows has a limit of 64 file descriptors and ENOMEM with -1
 * is returned if that limit is exceeded. In practice the limit is not
 * this low. For example, pollfds with fd<0 don't count. So the caller
 * could flip the sign bit with a short timeout, to poll a larger set.
 *
 * @param fds[𝑖].fd should be a socket, input pipe, or conosle input
 *     and if it's a negative number then the entry is ignored
 * @param fds[𝑖].events flags can have POLLIN, POLLOUT, POLLPRI,
 *     POLLRDNORM, POLLWRNORM, POLLRDBAND, POLLWRBAND as well as
 *     POLLERR, POLLHUP, and POLLNVAL although the latter are
 *     always implied (assuming fd≥0) so they're ignored here
 * @param timeout_ms if 0 means don't wait and -1 means wait forever
 * @return number of items fds whose revents field has been set to
 *     nonzero to describe its events, or 0 if the timeout elapsed,
 *     or -1 w/ errno
 * @return fds[𝑖].revents is always zero initializaed and then will
 *     be populated with POLL{IN,OUT,PRI,HUP,ERR,NVAL} if something
 *     was determined about the file descriptor
 * @raise ECANCELED if thread was cancelled in masked mode
 * @raise EINTR if signal was delivered
 * @cancellationpoint
 * @asyncsignalsafe
 * @threadsafe
 * @norestart
