DESCRIPTION

  Lua is a language designed for embedded use in native applications. It
  has an impossibly elegant C API and the Lua language itself feels more
  like Python compared to alternatives like Tcl except it's a great deal
  faster and doesn't have strong opinions about character encoding.

LOCAL MODIFICATIONS

  Lua now uses a bestline REPL with bash-style code completion.

  Integer literals such as `033` will now be interpreted as octal.

  Integer literals such as `0b10` will now be interpreted as binary.

  The `\e` string literal escape sequence has been added, which is
  equivalent to `\27` (the Lua version of `\033`) or the ASCII ESC
  character. It may be used for teletypewriter control like having
  bold text, which can be encoded elegantly as `\e[1mHELLO\e[0m`.

  Added luaL_traceback2() for function parameters in traceback.

  Added Python-like printf modulus operator for strings.

  Added Python-like printf multiply operator for strings.
