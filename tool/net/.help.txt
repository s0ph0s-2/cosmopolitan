USAGE

  This executable is also a ZIP file that contains static assets.
  You can run redbean interactively in your terminal as follows:

    ./redbean.com -vvvmbag        # starts server verbosely
    open http://127.0.0.1:8080/   # shows zip listing page
    CTRL-C                        # 1x: graceful shutdown
    CTRL-C                        # 2x: forceful shutdown

  You can override the default listing page by adding:

    zip redbean.com index.lua     # lua server pages take priority
    zip redbean.com index.html    # default page for directory

  The listing page only applies to the root directory. However the
  default index page applies to subdirectories too. In order for it
  to work, there needs to be an empty directory entry in the zip.
  That should already be the default practice of your zip editor.

    wget                     \
      --mirror               \
      --convert-links        \
      --adjust-extension     \
      --page-requisites      \
      --no-parent            \
      --no-if-modified-since \
      http://a.example/index.html
    zip -r redbean.com a.example/  # default page for directory

  redbean normalizes the trailing slash for you automatically:

    $ printf 'GET /a.example HTTP/1.0\n\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 8080
    HTTP/1.0 307 Temporary Redirect
    Location: /a.example/

  Virtual hosting is accomplished this way too. The Host is simply
  prepended to the path, and if it doesn't exist, it gets removed.

    $ printf 'GET / HTTP/1.1\nHost:a.example\n\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 8080
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Link: <http://127.0.0.1/a.example/index.html>; rel="canonical"

  If you mirror a lot of websites within your redbean then you can
  actually tell your browser that redbean is your proxy server, in
  which redbean will act as your private version of the Internet.

    $ printf 'GET http://a.example HTTP/1.0\n\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 8080
    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Link: <http://127.0.0.1/a.example/index.html>; rel="canonical"

  If you use a reverse proxy, then redbean recognizes the following
  provided that the proxy forwards requests over the local network:

    X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.42:31337
    X-Forwarded-Host: foo.example:80

  There's a text/plain statistics page called /statusz that makes
  it easy to track and monitor the health of your redbean:

    printf 'GET /statusz\n\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 8080

  redbean will display an error page using the /redbean.png logo
  by default, embedded as a bas64 data uri. You can override the
  custom page for various errors by adding files to the zip root.

    zip redbean.com 404.html      # custom not found page

  Audio video content should not be compressed in your ZIP files.
  Uncompressed assets enable browsers to send Range HTTP request.
  On the other hand compressed assets are best for gzip encoding.

    zip redbean.com index.html    # adds file
    zip -0 redbean.com video.mp4  # adds without compression

  You can have redbean run as a daemon by doing the following:

    redbean.com -vv -d -L redbean.log -P redbean.pid
    kill -TERM $(cat redbean.pid) # 1x: graceful shutdown
    kill -TERM $(cat redbean.pid) # 2x: forceful shutdown

  redbean currently has a 32kb limit on request messages and 64kb
  including the payload. redbean will grow to whatever the system
  limits allow. Should fork() or accept() fail redbean will react
  by going into "meltdown mode" which closes lingering workers.
  You can trigger this at any time using:

    kill -USR2 $(cat redbean.pid)

  Another failure condition is running out of disk space in which
  case redbean reacts by truncating the log file. Lastly, redbean
  does the best job possible reporting on resource usage when the
  logger is in debug mode noting that NetBSD is the best at this.

  Your redbean is an actually portable executable, that's able to
  run on six different operating systems. To do that, it needs to
  overwrite its own MZ header at startup, with ELF or Mach-O, and
  then puts the original back once the program loads. If you want
  your redbean to follow the platform-local executable convention
  then delete the /.ape file from zip.

  redbean contains software licensed ISC, MIT, BSD-2, BSD-3, zlib
  which makes it a permissively licensed gift to anyone who might
  find it useful. The transitive closure of legalese can be found
  inside the binary. redbean also respects your privacy and won't
  phone home because your computer is its home.
